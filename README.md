# Belly Button Biodiversity 

## Overview
Hundreds of eager navel-gazers participated in the study, donating samples at in-person events in the Raleigh-Durham area.

Volunteers participated in the study by twirling a sterile swab in their belly buttons to collect their microbes.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

The interactive dashboard consists of three sections:
* A selected individual's demographic information
* Bar chart of the top 10 OTUs found in that individual
* Bubble chart that displays each sample
